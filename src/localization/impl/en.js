We watch cartoons in class while I sleep. I\'m also cool and I love sweets: 5 candies is a grade of 5. I always dreamed of becoming a teacher so that I wouldn\'t have to work. Well, it has become, but you have to work. I made my husband write a website for me so that the students would study on it themselves. Actually part of this is a joke.',
