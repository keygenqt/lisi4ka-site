                        Hello! I am an English teacher. I teach at school 666. Just a hell of a teacher. I teach
                        everyone, I donâ€™t torture anyone. We watch cartoons in class while I sleep. I'm also cool and I
                        love sweets: 5 candies is a grade of 5. I always dreamed of becoming a teacher so that I
                        wouldn't have to work. Well, it has become, but you have to work. I made my husband write a
                        website for me so that the students would study on it themselves. Actually part of this is a
                        joke.
