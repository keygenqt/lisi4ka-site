Here will be the text that Julia will write. I have nothing to do with it, so for now I write what I can. For example, 
I was able to write this text for an example. But it was very short, so I\\'ll add another thread. So I can write that 
this text should not be very short, otherwise there will be nothing to read. If you write a post, then you should have 
something to talk about and not write from the bold as I do now)
