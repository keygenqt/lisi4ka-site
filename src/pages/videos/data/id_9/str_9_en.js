00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,360
- Hey, usually I share
with you my opinion,
but this time I would like to
ask you for your opinion.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,490
What would you do in, in this situation
I will describe you
Or how would you configure the situation?

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,470
Imagine there is a research team,
a group of programmers/researchers
who are doing some experiments.

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,000
They're trying to solve some problems,
not problem, problems usually.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,730
They're all looking at these problems
from different perspectives,
from different angles.

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,410
They're, and they are working on papers.

15
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:39,370
They're not only writing code
but they're also writing
scientific papers, academic papers
which are supposed to be published
in the end of the research
or during the research.

19
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,510
The papers are usually written
by not a single person,
but a few people.

22
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,840
So one person is writing.

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,067
And another person is
helping to edit the paper.

24
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:51,900
Another one is participating
in the discussions.

25
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,460
So maybe not even, you
know, typing the text there
but discussing the problems
and and suggesting.

27
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,730
Suggesting
solutions
and how to move the research
into a better direction.

30
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,150
So it's a group work, it's a teamwork.

31
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:15,960
But then the result of this teamwork
there is a paper which has an author,
an author or a number of authors
or an author and coauthors.

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,250
But usually now in academic world,
they just have a list of authors.

37
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,530
John,
Sarah,
Peter.

40
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,430
Three authors.

41
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:32,950
So the question is, how do we decide
in a group
who will be the author?

44
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,800
Let's say we have 10 people in the team.

45
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,230
10 people working
on the problem.

47
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,913
They working on the software solution and
they will generate five different papers.

49
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,530
So there are
basically three approaches.

51
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,490
Approach number one is we all
become coauthors.

53
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:01,080
10 people, 10 author, no
matter who is publishing,
no matter who is writing,
no matter what kind of paper it is,
no matter what the paper is about.

57
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,340
10 people, they just go in there.

58
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,280
They become all authors, no
exceptions, no exclusions.

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,330
That's a scenario number one.

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,540
And remember, we are
trying to make a rule.

61
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:22,960
So we are trying to decide
that it's gonna be happen from now
till the very end of our
the end of a lifetime
of this, of this group.

65
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,200
Not even the project, but the group.

66
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,790
So it's, it's a rule it has to be set.

67
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,480
So everybody knows what is
the rule, what to expect.

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:40,420
Approach number two, the
person who is responsible,
the main author, the main person
who is actually typing most of the text,
who is driving the paper
forward, becomes the author.

72
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,230
And we always assign that person.

73
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,030
So when we start writing a new paper,
we say, okay now it's your paper.

75
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,280
So this is, this is Sarah.

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,490
So Sarah, okay, write a
paper, make it your paper.

77
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,330
You will publish.

78
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,680
And Sarah
becomes
the author number one.

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,510
And then Sarah invites
other people as she wishes.

82
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,520
She says Peter was helping
me, so I invite Peter.

83
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,210
Maybe she doesn't even explain why.

84
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,120
It's just her personal decision.

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,030
She makes the decision
Peter is the coauthor.

86
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,860
So I invite Peter and we
don't debate this decision.

87
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,693
That's the rule.

88
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,020
So the author, the primary
author of the paper.

89
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,640
Even if this decision is not fair.

90
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,810
Maybe the author will just say
I don't want anybody to be coauthors.

92
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,010
So I just be myself.

93
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,460
It's just gonna be my paper.

94
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,940
And we all just eat it,
just swallow it,
and say, okay, that's the way it is.

97
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,220
That's the second approach.

98
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:40,610
And the approach number
three, which I use,
which I see more and more
often is the approach
where the decision is made ad hoc.

101
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,310
So we just, we just make a decision
with no particular rule behind it.

103
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:54,980
It's just, yeah, these three people,
because they were working
more on this paper,
just because, so decisions
is made by somehow.

106
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,600
There's no clear explanation.

107
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,950
There's no real set of
rules written on the wall,
and anybody can just
look at it and understand
okay that's the rule we use in our team.

110
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,860
So I'm asking you, what
do you think is better?

111
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,060
The first approach, the
second one or the third one?

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,910
So probably if you are
subscribed to my channel
then you will probably cross
out the option number three
because we are all, you
know, we all like rules.

115
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,129
I mean, I am trying to tell you this
for many many years on
my blog and my videos.

117
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,350
The rules are better than
the absence of rules.

118
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,750
But let's consider two first options.

119
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,250
The rule number one, everybody.

120
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,980
The rule number two, one
person and coauthors.

121
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,410
So what's good in the first approach?

122
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,630
It will not offend.

123
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,470
It is supposed to not offend anybody.

124
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,560
Of course, it may offend.

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,960
For example, the person
just quits the group,
and we still publish the paper.

127
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,397
So shall we include the person
who was working with us two
years ago on this project.

129
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:53,180
And she quit two years ago
and went to work for Google.

130
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,030
Now she's in Google,
but we continue writing,
continue working on that, continue writing
those papers we started two years ago.

133
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,120
Shall we include that
person as a coauthor?

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,200
That's a tricky question, hard to answer.

135
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,340
But if the answer will be, of course not,
then it will demotivate
people who stay with us.

137
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:18,840
Now they will understand that
no matter how much they invest right now,
the time and efforts,
they will be most probably excluded
if they decide to quit in sometime.

142
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,000
So that's the trickiest scenario.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,720
But still everybody means everybody.

144
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
10 people means 10 people.

145
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,150
Just everybody, to not offend anybody.

146
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,600
That's the principle.

147
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,130
And the second option,
there are also benefits.

148
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:54,260
So if you,
if you let the primary author
be the decision maker,
then it gives extra motivation,
additional motivation
for that person
to stand out
and to demonstrate their
achievements much better
than being just
inside a list of coauthors
among everybody else
who maybe not work as good as that person.

158
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,370
Because you know, in a team of 10 people
it's impossible to imagine
that all 10 people they
contribute equally.

161
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,090
Sometimes there will be lazy people.

162
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,740
Sometimes there will be
people who don't work
because they don't like to work. Whatever.

164
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,810
There could be many
reasons for having people
who contribute much
less than somebody else.

166
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:20,570
So that's somebody else
who's a top contributor,
who works day and night on this paper,
who puts a lot of effort into it.

169
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:37,420
He or she will not be happy to see
that after the paper is published
his name or her name stays
on the position number five
among other 10 guys who,
most of who, or some of who,
barely touched the keyboard
during the lifetime of the project.

175
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,480
So that's a negative side.

176
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:48,600
It may demotivate that key performers,
if we apply the the principle
from the first scenario.

179
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,330
So in this case, the second scenario
is kind of gives advantages
to top performers.

181
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,210
It just says, you'll be the author.

182
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,620
You'll be the paper publisher.

183
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:07,570
So everybody else, they
will try to help you
in order to motivate you to involve,
to include me,
include them into the list of co-authors.

187
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,120
For example, I'm in the team.

188
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:18,780
I see this guy he's working
hard to publish a paper
and I see that the paper
potentially could be,
could be publishable and
could be really good paper.

191
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,210
I will try to help that person.

192
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,800
I will try to work with them.

193
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,680
I will try to say, how can I help you,
maybe invite me for the meeting,
invite me for the discussion.

196
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,930
Let me write something for you.

197
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,990
Maybe write you some software,
so I will try to help.

199
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,080
But there are negative sides
and positive sides in both options.

202
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,390
So I'm asking you, what do you think?

203
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,640
Maybe you can share your experience
how it works in your team,
how it works in your group.

206
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,500
So how it happens.

207
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,333
What's the rule?

208
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,710
What's the principle of the authorship?

209
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:52,980
So who gets the privilege of
being authors of the papers
your group is publishing?

211
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,830
Thanks for listening.

212
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,010
I'm waiting for answers.

213
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,843
Stay tuned.

214
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,676
Bye-bye.
