1
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,770
All right guys well, it's day one here in India.

2
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,900
It's my first full day in India, and this place is incredible, to say the least.

3
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,050
We're going to be kicking off this tour of Rajasthan here in Jaipur, and what do we have in store today?

4
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,030
We're going to be going on a week-long tour of Rajasthan.

5
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,569
Rajasthan is one of the most colorful States in India.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,699
Rajasthan basically means Land of the Rajas or Land of the Kings because there's a ton of different

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,939
princely states or little kingdoms that make up this entire state.

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,600
So as you may or may not know, I used to live in India 9 years ago now,

9
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,440
and I came through Rajasthan when I finished my job.

10
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey, this is me and I want to show you my hotel here in Udaipur

11
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,500
where I am paying two dollars and fifty cents a night

12
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,080
So check this out. I went to a lot of places that

13
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,520
we're going to go and to the legendary Pushkar Camel Festival

14
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,359
So I'm super stoked to show this place to you and to all of you guys.

15
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,979
We're going to be making an entire series about Rajasthan, the most colorful state in India.

16
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,460
We'll be visiting the three main cities in this series starting here in Jaipur, the Pink City,

17
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,100
Udaipur, the White City and Jodhpur, the Blue City.

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,820
We'll be wrapping everything up at the legendary Pushkar Camel Festival.

19
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,700
Wait. Camel festival? yeah.

20
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,400
Pushkar Camel Festival is going to be a holy ceremony,

21
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,240
also a camel trading ceremony.

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,160
It's pretty damn interesting.

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,910
It's going to be a feast for the eyes. So stay tuned for all of that.

24
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,780
Over this trip, we'll be shooting to virtual reality films.

25
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,840
So be prepared for those.

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
One is going to be the Grand Tour of Rajasthan,

27
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,100
and the other is going to be the Pushcart Camel Fair in 360 degrees.

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,380
We're joined by Carlos Mason, the talented cinematographer who is coming with us

29
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,560
to Peru to South Korea and helps us on East of Eden.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,180
We're also joined by Celine Tricart.

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,720
She is a VR specialist who will be helping us with two VR films.

32
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,900
We're starting off here at the Amer Fort in Jaipur, so there's tons to explore. Let's get started. Let's go.

33
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,860
We are posted up on the wall.

34
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,279
Just trying to get a nice establishing shot, but...

35
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,579
What a crazy place.  There's so much happening.

36
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,400
There's literally a procession of elephants

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,360
carrying people up the ramparts and into the fortress.

38
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,700
Making new friends, Marko?

39
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,630
Making new friends. You girls from Rajasthan?  No

40
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,060
How do you say cheese in Hindi? Cheese.   Paneer.

41
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,280
So apparently it's a thing here in India;

42
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,980
people just like to take selfies with you

43
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,040
If you're from the west, then you're just a good  person to take a selfie with.

44
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,010
Good job

45
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,280
All right, well here we are at the top of Jaigarh Fort.

46
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,440
Exactly.  Garh means fort and Jai named after Jai Singh who was one of the Maharajahs here.

47
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,499
A Maharaja is a Hindi word which means Great King and

48
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,430
Rajasthan, Land of the Kings, because like this place,

49
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,400
there is a dozen or so kingdoms that were all ruled independently for hundreds of years.

50
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,009
Nowadays itt's a great spot to kind of get some elevation and really take in the landscape, but it's incredible.

51
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,849
There're these walls that are just hugging the hills, almost like a little miniature version of the Great Wall of China.

52
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,620
An Incredible, incredible place to kind of get your bearings for your first day in Rajasthan.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,920
It's true what you say about the Great Wall of China because these walls,

54
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,140
like the Great Wall of China, were built to keep out invading armies.

55
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,540
The Greeks came through here;

56
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,560
Genghis Khan came through here and the Mughals, which was a Muslim empire from Central Asia, they all passed through here.

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,780
And they were resisted on these very walls.  Pretty incredible place.  So much history.

58
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:50,409
Honestly, trying to encapsulate the history of this place in a YouTube video is a challenge

59
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,700
We're going to do our best.  So stay with us as we continue to explore Rajasthan.

60
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,100
Pretty interesting piece of information here.

61
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,460
Back in the day when this was inhabited by the Rajas,

62
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,349
when there were bad people, when they did something wrong, they would be taken here,

63
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,060
and this little pit behind me used to be full of water,

64
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,400
and in that water there were crocodiles.

65
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,060
In a very James Bond villain-esque move,

66
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,500
they would throw the people who've been condemned to death into the crocodile pond.

67
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,890
They didn't have tunas with laser beams, but they had crocodiles.

68
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,800
This is an extremely well designed fortress.

69
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,690
You can see  down here ..these are for arrows.

70
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,200
This right here is for burning hot oil

71
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,900
so you could pour it on anyone trying to climb up the fort.

72
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,529
And then the big holes, those are for cannons, including the largest cannon on wheels in the world which is just down here.

73
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,419
So all these fortresses a lot of the buildings that we're going to see across the series in Rajasthan

74
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,780
We're built in the 14 and 1500s.

75
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,009
This was a time when Europe was really just emerging from the Dark Ages

76
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,800
But here in India these civilizations were reaching heights that were renowned around the world.

77
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,540
So now you appreciate the world's largest cannon.

78
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,180
Just look at those rims.. the spinning, the spinning, the spinning

79
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,720
They're not spinning now  They're not spinning.

80
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,480
This thing is huge. Apparently when they shot it,

81
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,760
it destroyed a town that it was aimed at, and the guy who shot it was so blasted back by the reverberations.

82
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,520
he fell off the back to his death.

83
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,680
That is what we'd call blowback.

84
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,180
Celine, you have an audience.  Yeah, I know.

85
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,200
I've never been that famous in my life.  It's awesome, isn't it?

86
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
I don't want to ever leave India

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,940
There's been a minor car accident

88
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,420
Our driver accidentally

89
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,720
smashed into a little wall.

90
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,580
We are on foot in the town of Amer.

91
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,430
This is like old, used to be old Jaipur,

92
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,640
but now it's just kind of on the outskirts.

93
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,900
It's like in the suburbs really

94
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,140
but we're passing all sorts of temples and

95
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
kind of wandering these little back streets.

96
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,620
So this is pretty awesome.

97
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,740
Right now, we are at a step well and most of India is like tropical or subtropical.

98
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,669
But up here in Rajasthan were on the edge of the Thar Desert or the Great Indian Desert.

99
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,090
it's two hundred thousand square kilometres and

100
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,960
In order to basically conserve the water that they get during the monsoon they built these large step wells.

101
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,580
At the bottom down there is water.

102
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,970
These were built a couple hundred years ago, but awesome place for photography

103
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,540
And it looks like some surreal kind of Modern Art.

104
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,806
It's my first day back in India, and I'm falling in love all over again.

105
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,960
You have to love this country.  It's just got so much happiness.

106
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,380
There're people; there're smells; there're sounds.

107
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,979
It never stops, and it's such a productive country.

108
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,029
There're trees growing everywhere. There're monkeys. There're animals and cows wandering through the streets.

109
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,749
It's a lot of taking on your first day, but if you can slow down and appreciate it,

110
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,260
you can really, really fall in love with this place as I have, as well.

111
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,740
We it into the center of Jaipur:

112
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,329
the madness continues as always here in India.

113
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,709
We are going to go try to get one last VR shot for the day and

114
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:45,069
That is at a place called the Hawa Mahal, which is really fun to say.

115
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:47,860
Although it is chaotic Jaipur is India's first planned city.

116
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,079
It was built in 1700 when they the city down here

117
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,408
And it's all set out in the grid formation.  Each little rectangular

118
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,028
block is a different sort of bizarre, so it's just a giant marketplace.

119
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,280
This guy is awesome.

120
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,580
One of the best things about India is masala chai.

121
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,740
Chai is a Hindi word for tea and it's super awesome here

122
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,219
It's very sweet; its spiced, and it's served right here on the street.

123
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,468
And you know what, Mark?

124
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:26,200
It gives a whole new meaning to the dirty chai. Oh dear.

125
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,280
Take a look at the place behind us.

126
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,380
He's authentic as it can get. It's chai, and it's dirty, and we're drinking it.

127
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,020
It's delicious so the guy who sells called chai wallah

128
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,980
and here chai comes to five rupees, which is just couple of cents. It's amazing

129
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,440
So there's been a slight change of plans.

130
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,580
The light is really not that good on it right now,

131
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,079
so we're going to head back into the city palace

132
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,780
There's a little bit better light in there.

133
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,730
We'll get some b-roll on the Odyssey, and then take some photos.

134
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,639
The elephant owner just got off and is literally grabbing a drink over here.

135
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
This big beautiful elephant.

136
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,009
Okay, well, it's official... India's the coolest country on earth.

137
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,950
So this behind us is the Hawa Mahal

138
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,580
Mahal means palace in Hindi, and this translates to Palace of the Wind.

139
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,339
So back in the day when the city was built

140
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,040
this was the women's section of the city and this area right here was designed

141
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,560
so that women could look out onto the street, but not be seen.

142
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,300
The Maharaja at that time were Hindu, but in that time Hindus also

143
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,320
had to be covered from public view so this was a way of doing that.

144
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,270
It was painted pink which is a symbol of hospitality here

145
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,560
in honor of the Prince of Wales who was coming here to play polo with the Maharaja.

146
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,940
Oh my god.

147
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,219
That was a wild day, first day in India. Madness

148
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,899
Beautiful beautiful madness, and I can't wait for tomorrow

149
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,400
I'd say, I'm kind of jealous.

150
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,599
My first day in India two weeks after graduating college

151
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,779
was the craziest experience of my life.

152
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:54,460
I think that there's no amount of culture shock that amounts to your first day in India. it's incomparable.

153
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,399
I was a bit jealous that you're going through that today because I remember how much it changed me.

154
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,890
I think that it's cliche to say that going to India changed your life

155
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,069
But this is just the first day of a whole multiple week trip

156
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,960
I was really happy to have you as my India guide, bro and just kind of being able to navigate

157
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,559
the chaos that unfolds on the outside of this little sanctuary, our hotel.

158
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,980
But it's been an incredible day, and I really cannot wait for more exploration tomorrow.

159
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,120
