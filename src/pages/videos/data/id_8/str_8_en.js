00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:08,660
- Hey! I got a question from one
of my subscribers who found a
contradiction in two thoughts
which I deliver in my presentations.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,810
On one side, I'm saying that a programmer
has to work just a few hours a day.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,890
And I did say that.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:27,660
On another hand, on another side,
I'm saying that a good
programmer is the one
who is passionate about the
profession, who works a lot,
who basically doesn't
close the laptop ever.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,410
So where do I stand?

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,243
So what's right?

13
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:30,576
What's wrong?

14
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:32,770
Do programmers have to work a lot?

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,090
Or they have to just
spend a few hours a day?

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,510
And then the question
from this subscriber was,
"What else to do?"

19
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,570
If you just work for
two, three hours a day
then what do you do in
the rest of the time?

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,100
What the programmer, a good programmer,
who I believe is a good
programmer has to spend time for.

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:01:03,150
There is no contradiction
because I believe that
work
is one thing
and having fun doing programming
and working with the code,
working with technical
problems is another thing.

30
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,040
That's what I do.

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,040
That's what I think is makes sense to me.

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:29,930
When you do something
which gives fun to you,
when you learn something,
when you practice some new languages,
when you try some new frameworks,
when you create new frameworks,
when you read interesting books,
when you write interesting books,
when you write your blog posts,
when you answer questions on stack overflow,
when you create some open source path projects,
this is how you have fun.

43
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,330
This is your life.

44
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,740
So this is what you do
ideally, 24 hours a day.

45
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,960
Of course, you need time to sleep.

46
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,820
You need time to eat.

47
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,790
You need time to spend
time with your family.

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,739
But ideally in the perfect world,
24 hours a day, I would do that.

50
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:47,680
I would just spend time
to get fun from life
by working with computers.

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,026
This is not what I call work.

53
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,680
This is what I call
investment into the future.

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,620
This is how I invest
to make myself better,
to make myself as a professional, better.

56
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,910
That's my investment.

57
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,890
And then I have to live somehow,
'cause nobody's gonna pay me for that,
'cause this is how I make fun.

60
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,169
Some people play games on the computer,
they play Tanks,
they play World of Warcraft
and I don't do that.

63
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,078
I play with the code.

64
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:13,660
But nobody's gonna pay for that.

65
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,493
It's just fun.

66
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:15,740
On the other hand, I have to make money.

67
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,630
So I have to go somewhere and
do some projects for somebody.

68
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:28,758
So I have to write code for
somebody, for some company
for some employer or maybe some kind,
the customer or somebody who will pay.

71
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,660
And there will be no fun, less fun.

72
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,970
Of course, ideally in an ideal world,
I will also have fun there, but much less
In real world, it's much less fun.

75
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,437
And for most of you,
there'll be no fun at all
or really small amount of fun
because they will tell
you to do what they need.

78
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:45,760
And in most cases, you're not
gonna like that business wise.

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,790
You're not gonna like the
concept of what they do.

80
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,880
They're not gonna like,
you're not gonna like
the business cases and all that.

82
00:02:51,880 --> 00:03:00,480
But you have to do that
in order to get the money, in
order to continue having fun,
in order to continue doing
something interesting,
in order to continue
investing into yourself.

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,099
So the more you can invest into yourself
the better professional you will become.

88
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,407
And the less amount of time
you will have to spend on making money.

90
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:21,408
So if you're very good professional,
a really top one, top world class guy,
who knows something very special
and who can solve really complex problems
can get, I don't know, $300 an hour.

95
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:25,420
Then you just can work
for one, two hours a day
and that will be enough for you.

97
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,540
To have enough money, to
have an ability to have fun.

98
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:37,187
So the more expensive
you are on the market,
the more professional you are,
the more these people will pay
for your 2, 3, 4 hours a day.

101
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:39,730
And then you can go back to fun.

102
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:47,270
And instead of playing Tanks
and playing World of Warcraft
but you will invest time into
yourself becoming better.

104
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,020
Because every time you have fun,
every time you do something interesting,
that's how you become better.

107
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,550
You cannot become better
by just doing routine work
where people pay for you.

109
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,370
No matter what you think about.

110
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,223
No matter what people who
hire you think about this.

111
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:05,930
You become better by doing things for fun.

112
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,747
I believe in that.

113
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,870
Because that's how you learn,
because that's how you practice new stuff.

115
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:19,377
That's how you face the
challenges much more actively
than when you work with stuff for money.

117
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:29,990
So there has to be the balance
between the time you spend
on the projects where
you collect the money
and the time you spend on projects
where you invest the money or your time.

122
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,580
And in an ideal world, like
two, three hours a day here
and all of your time here.

124
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:47,080
And if you do a lot of work
here, if you work eight hours
for your boss, eight
hours for your customer,
then you have almost zero time because you
you need to spend time with your family.

128
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,180
You need to sleep, you need to eat.
So there will be not enough time
to really invest into yourself.

131
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,460
And you will degrade quickly.

132
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:00,020
You will become just a
routine programmer who,
at best, can make an
average amount of money,
an average amount on the market.

135
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:12,093
So try to minimize the amount
of time you spend for your boss,
you spend for for the projects where
you collect the money
and spend more time on the projects
where you invest time
and money into yourself.

141
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:16,410
But on the other hand,
you cannot make this time
taking all of your time.

143
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,620
Because in this case
you stop making money and eventually
you will again get out of the market.

146
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,330
So you will,
you may go out of the
market because you will
stop understanding what the
customers may need from you.

149
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,580
So you may stop inventing.

150
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,860
You may start inventing
things which nobody needs.

151
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,250
You may go into learning something
which is completely
detached on the reality.

153
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:45,740
So there has to be the
balance between investing
into yourself and collecting the paychecks
50-50, I don't know - maybe this balance.

156
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:55,011
But I am always into trying
to make this part larger,
trying to make investing part,
'cause it's more fun,
larger than collecting the money.

160
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:59,800
So think about this,
this is the balance - a few
hours here, more hours there.

162
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:09,510
And that's how you grow,
that's how you become better,
that's how your profile grows,
that's how you eventually get yourself
into the situation where one
hour of your time costs $300.

167
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,530
In this case, you can work
for a few hours or maybe
a few days and then
and then take a rest for a few weeks.

170
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:25,220
Or maybe you can work for for
a month and then take a rest,
a long vacation, not a
vacation, but a long time
to have fun with computers
for maybe a year or so.

173
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,620
That would be the ideal position.

174
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,480
Not eight hours every day in the office.

175
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,496
That's completely lousy position
which totally degrades
you and leads you nowhere.

177
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:37,710
I hope I told you something interesting.

178
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,010
Thanks for listening.

179
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,843
Stay tuned.

180
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:40,676
Bye bye.
