00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,660
What's up? You're watching Vagabrothers,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,160
and this is Peru.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,180
What's going on Vagabuddies?

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,120
Welcome back to the channel.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,860
Right now we are in Lima, Peru.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,400
It's our first time coming to this country,

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,630
and we are super excited to be here.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,430
We've got a lot of things to tell you.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,900
We're in Peru because we're part of a program at YouTube to make four virtual reality videos,

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,510
and we're going to make a VR tour of Machu Picchu.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,749
But we didn't want to come all the way down here for just a couple of days.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,500
So we've arrived a little bit early to explore Cusco and Lima, as well.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,790
To capture the experience better,

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,880
we're bringing along our friend and colleague, Carlos Mason,

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,359
the cinematographer behind East of Eden and our virtual reality

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,540
mentor, DJ, to help us capture Machu Picchu,

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,440
the best we possibly can.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,379
It's going to be an awesome adventure.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,180
We're going to eat well.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,620
We're going meet some Peruvian friends.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,800
We're going to explore the culture and the history.... all of that jazz,

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,060
but first things first:

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,560
here's what you've got to know about Peru.

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,460
Peru is a land of contrasts, both ancient and modern,

25
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,660
indigenous and European.

26
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,420
And with over 90 micro climates,

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,949
it's one of the most biodiverse places on earth.

28
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,360
The coast has great surfing.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
The Andes are the largest mountain range in the world after the Himalaya.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,669
Lake Titicaca is the highest navigable

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,040
lake in the world and the largest in South America.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,909
Plus, it's just fun to say.

33
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,030
Titicaca.

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,600
Peru was home to the Inca Empire known as Tawantinsuyu

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,629
or the Empire of the Four Cardinal Points.

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,559
It's golden era only lasted around a hundred years until the Spanish arrived in 1532 and Pizarro

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,739
captured, ransomed, and murdered their Emperor Atahualpa before ransacking their capital, Cusco.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,900
Pizarro then moved the capital to Lima, which he called the City of Kings.

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,089
It became the capital of and most important city in

40
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,619
the Viceroyalty of Peru, which was essentially all of Spanish Latin America.

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,160
Today Lima is still the capital.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,340
It's home to about a third of Peru's 32 million people,

43
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,780
and it's the driest capital on earth,

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,340
except for Cairo.

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,980
Peru has more shamans in any other country in the world,

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,470
thanks to the Amazon where the local drug ayahuasca has been used as a medicine for thousands of years.

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,160
Meanwhile in the Andes, locals use coca leaves, the base ingredient for cocaine

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,950
to combat hunger and altitude sickness.

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't worry. It's not addictive, but does make your tongue go kind of numb.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Today 45% of Peruvians are indigena, making it one of the most indigenous countries in South America.

51
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,940
15% are Criollo,

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,309
Peruvian born Spanish, and 37% are mestizo or mixed.

53
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,969
Peru was also home to a small but active Japanese community,

54
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,020
which came here in the 1800s to escape the Shogun Wars

55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,229
and left their mark through Peruvian Japanese fusion cuisine known as Nikkei.

56
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,640
Peruvian food has had a massive impact on global cuisine.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,209
Ireland would not have the potato,

58
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,240
America would not have corn,

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,979
and there would be no Indian curries without chilies from Peru,

60
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,394
all brought overseas by Portuguese and Spanish traders.

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,260
For some reason Peru's national dish cuy didn't catch on.

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,300
In English we call it the guinea pig

63
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,700
because sailors who used to go from Lima to London would stop in West Africa, and

64
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,700
merchants thought that's where it came from.

65
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,940
Lima is one of the best foodie cities in the world,

66
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,620
and it's the only city to have two restaurants in the global top ten,

67
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,660
including Central, the best restaurant in Latin America,

68
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,394
which was recently featured on season three of Chef's Table.

69
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:50,639
That's a big cactus.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,740
Ready to book your ticket?

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,449
Here's what you need to know before you fly.

72
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,419
The currency in Peru is called the Nuevo Sol and there's about three solace to a dollar.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,569
Peruvian power outlets are 220 volts, and they take both US style and European style plugs.

74
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,569
A 2 for 1.

75
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,420
Beyond Spanish there's two main languages in Peru:

76
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,409
Quechua the ancient language of the Inca spoken in the Andes and Aymara one of the oldest

77
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,600
languages in the world spoken in the Lake Titicaca region,

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
not to mention 27 other languages in the Amazon.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,560
So if you're a linguist, if you like speaking languages,

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,900
this is the country for you.

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,980
Budget-wise, Peru's a mid-level destination.

82
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,450
You can easily get by on less than $50 a day or even $40, which makes it cheaper than Chile,

83
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,040
but more expensive than Bolivia.

84
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,340
Peru is near the equator and can be visited all year long.

85
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,499
June to August at the dry season

86
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,160
is great for hiking the Inca Trail.

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,450
December to March is the hot season -perfect for the beach.

88
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,680
You can save money in the shoulder season September to November

89
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,700
or March to May when the weather is still pretty good

90
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,690
and there's not that many tourists.

91
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,520
From the ocean to the Andes,

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,600
Peru has tons of different climates,

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,010
so it's super important to pack in layers.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,120
A waterproof shell is essential- it rains a lot up here- as is a stuffable jacket because it does get cold.

95
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,860
Or you could just pick up a nice alpaca sweater from one of the many markets for ten dollars U.S.

96
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,360
Peru is a rugged country, so make sure you have the right footwear.

97
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:20,480
Even if you're just planning on walking around Machu Picchu, bring solid hiking boots.

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,529
It rains a lot. It's muddy, and it's slippery.

99
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,080
All right,  I'm stoked.

100
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,740
We have never been to Peru before.

101
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,838
This is the home of the Inca Empire.

102
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:00,709
It's really a place that we've wanted to visit for a super long time.

103
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,129
We're very excited to be down here to be filming.

104
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,588
He said that it's part of the Incan Empire,

105
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:09,182
but the Inca Empire was really the most recent of many.

106
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,879
There were tons of civilizations here,

107
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,869
including here in Lima, which although it is a Spanish colonial city,

108
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:17,500
it's named after the Lima people.

109
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,769
We're on our way to go see

110
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,060
some of the remains of that civilization from about 400 AD.

111
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,100
And then we're going to get food.

112
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,920
Supposedly, there's really, really good food in Lima.

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,020
First stop here in Lima and our first stop here in Peru is Huaca Pucllana

114
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,860
This is the remains of a temple from the Lima people who were the original inhabitants of the city before the arrival the Spanish.

115
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,480
Unfortunately, it's closed today.

116
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,940
We're not allowed to go up there, and you can only do guided tours,

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,609
but you can see behind us is just this crazy pyramid full of basically adobe bricks.

118
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,350
And it's in the middle of the city

119
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,220
And I think it just goes to show the contrast between old- new here in Peru.

120
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,100
You have some of the oldest, most advanced civilizations in all the Americas

121
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,070
right in the middle of a bustling metropolis.

122
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,880
Honestly though it's just mind boggling that this entire complex is made of individual bricks.

123
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,100
There has to be hundreds of thousands, if not

124
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,989
millions of bricks, and the pyramid just over there has so many different layers.

125
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,340
It must have been quite the task to excavate this place, archaeologically speaking.

126
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,600
Total bummer that we can't go explore more, but we're going to go see the more modern layer of

127
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,720
Peruvian history here- that of the Spanish.

128
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:06,480
We've just arrived to the Plaza de Armas just in front of us here.

129
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,359
And like we said, Peru is playing Colombia tonight.

130
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,460
Their national football teams are facing up.

131
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,580
We didn't know that the game was going to be happening when we planned this day.

132
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,200
We came here because this is the center of old Spanish Lima.

133
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,400
When the Spanish conquered the Inca, they moved the capital from Cusco to Lima.

134
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
They built all their houses right here.

135
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,300
Anyways, the game's about to start.  So let's just go jump in there and see what happens.

136
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,159
We finally found a quiet spot so I can explain why the Spanish built the city here.

137
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,250
It's because of this river.

138
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,520
Basically, the river connects the mountains all the way down the Port of Callao

139
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,979
and the Spanish built a city on the coast.

140
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,660
They were a seafaring nation.

141
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,280
In order to take the silver and gold from the Inca and

142
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,600
ship it off to Spain.

143
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
This was the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru.

144
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
There were three Viceroyalties at the time:

145
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
one in Mexico,

146
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,860
one in Lima, and the other one the Española,

147
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,540
the first island the Spanish colonized.

148
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,620
And the whole thing was about shipping gold back to Spain.

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Pretty much all of Spanish South America was controlled from this city.

150
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,380
It became very, very powerful and the old Inca capital of

151
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,420
Cusco kind of faded into history.

152
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,910
The conquista, the Spanish conquista of Latin America was one of the most brutal

153
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,640
periods of history.

154
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,800
They destroyed some of the most incredible

155
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,670
indigenous cultures,

156
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,560
Including the Inca and the Aztecs,

157
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,526
and it is a part of history.

158
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,240
It's not a pretty one, but

159
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,540
It's just kind of interesting to see how all of this stuff blends five hundred years later.

160
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
We're in the neighborhood of Pueblo Libre at Taberna Queirolo

161
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,620
It was basically founded by Italian immigrants who came here to grow Pisco.

162
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,880
Pisco, you might have heard of from a Pisco Sour,

163
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,620
but it's actually a grape liqueur.

164
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,640
The story is that during colonial times, the Spanish would not let locals grow their own wine

165
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,419
because they were importing it from Spain.

166
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,969
So the locals made a liquor

167
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,080
from grapes instead of making wine ..that's pisco.

168
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,270
These guys came from Italy to grow the Pisco,

169
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,890
and they still do.

170
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,229
I've ordered a Pisco puro,

171
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,120
which is just pure Pisco,

172
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
and Alex and Carlos got a Pisco Sour.

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,940
All right salud. Here's to a good week here in Peru.

174
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,560
This is actually my first Pisco Sour ever.

175
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,000
We've had a realization.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,640
As we are almost the only people in this room and everybody else is in the other room watching futbol.

177
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,760
It's insane to see how important it is globally.

178
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
When the World Cup happens,  national fever is

179
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,400
expressed in a competitive,

180
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,660
but collaborative way, and I think that America is just so

181
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,610
self-centered with our sports.

182
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,960
We're so wrapped up with the NFL and with Major League Baseball.

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,669
The World Series is not a World Series.

184
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,840
It's cool to come abroad and to see people so excited

185
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
about futbol.

186
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,260
But just to correct you.

187
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,680
You said you're an American whereas people here also say that they are Americans too because in Spanish,

188
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,900
America is one continent, not two.

189
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,839
Although you are a united.. you're a  "estadounidense""  Soy gringo.

190
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,240
We have made it back to the hotel.

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,119
Good job, Peru.  Good job, Colombia

192
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,920
You guys tied in the game,

193
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,660
but we have just begun our time here in Peru.

194
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,758
I think watching a football match, especially that we didn't know it was going to happen,

195
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:34,220
was a pretty good way to kind of get right into the local way of doing things.

196
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,729
I would say it's like diving

197
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,629
directly into the deep end.

198
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,477
It's been sweet and pisco sour.

199
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:42,540
We're going to sign off the vlog at this,

200
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,709
and we'll see you guys tomorrow

201
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,439
We're going to be going all around Lima,

202
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:50,279
which is one of the best foodie cities in the world, and we're doing it with some local YouTubers.

203
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,960
So we'll see you guys tomorrow.

204
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,219
In the meantime if you like this video,

205
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,220
you know what to do: give a thumbs- up, share with your friends, and subscribe to Vagabrothers

206
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,899
and turn on notifications, if you have not already.

207
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,120
And as always stay curious, keep exploring and we'll see you on the road.

208
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,360
Buenas noches

209
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,840
Hasta luego.  Hasta mañana. Ciao.
