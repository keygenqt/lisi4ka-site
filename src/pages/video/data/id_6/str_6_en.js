2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,100
and this is Sri Lanka

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,920
I'm Alex. I'm Marko, and we're the Vagabrothers...

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,660
brothers, vagabonds, and your go-to guides for travel tips, inspiration, and vlogs on YouTube.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,389
In this series, we're discovering the best of Sri Lanka:

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,619
ancient cities,

7
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,970
stunning nature,

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,420
rich culture, and delicious food.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,160
In Episode 1,  we're exploring the capital city, Colombo

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,900
and sharing our essential tips on what you need to know before you go to Sri Lanka.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,920
What's going on everybody?

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,100
Welcome back to the channel .

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,280
Right now we are in Colombo in Sri Lanka

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,689
about to start a 10-day adventure across this incredible island.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm excited because I've never been to Sri Lanka,

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,529
but I've heard incredible things about ancient cities, beautiful beaches with great surf,

17
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,482
amazing food, and an incredible blend of cultures that make up this island.

18
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:02,209
We're going to start things off here in Colombo.

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,420
We're here again with Carlos Mason, our good buddy and cinematographer, who's helped us out on previous trips.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,040
Not to mention, we've brought along Carrie Rad, my girlfriend, so it's going to be a super fun trip.

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,219
We're going to see a lot of this country, but first things first,

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,160
we're starting off here in Colombo with a city tour.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,900
Before we do anything, here's what you need to know before you go to Sri Lanka.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,390
Sri Lanka, the pearl of the Indian Ocean, has a rich blend of cultures and influences,

25
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,210
thanks to its position on the maritime trading routes, which brought spices from Asia to Europe.

26
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,309
Sri Lanka was an early center of Buddhism, and to this day, many pilgrims come to pay respect to its many temples while travelers

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,360
enjoy the ancient art of Ayurvedic holistic healing.

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,980
Sri Lanka is the original source of cinnamon, which has attracted

29
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,160
foreign traders since ancient times- from the Romans to the Arabs

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,559
and colonists like the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the English whose churches,

31
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,619
fortresses, and plantations are still here today.

32
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,389
Travelers from most countries need a visa, but you can get it online for 35 bucks and the application takes just five minutes.

33
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,330
Just don't leave it until the last day.  Give yourself 48 hours minimum.

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,909
Sri Lanka is quite good value.

35
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,800
Budget travelers can get by for about fifty dollars per day

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,480
by taking local buses, trains, and eating simple meals like rice and curry

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,240
for around two or three dollars per dish.

38
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,573
Hiring a driver will make it much easier to get around,

39
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:49,139
but it's going to cost you around two hundred dollars per day/ per person.

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,800
Travelling in Sri Lanka is often dictated by the monsoon.

41
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,550
So if one side of the island is rainy, another part might be dry.

42
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,829
The best weather is between December and April.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,489
The rainy season is between May to August ,,

44
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,619
and we're filming this series in the shoulder season-

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,336
September and November where the weather is still pretty good,

46
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,570
but you can often get thirty percent off at hotels.

47
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,689
Lastly remember to bring sunscreen,

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,379
mosquito repellent, hats, and also ladies - do not forget your tampons because they are hard to come by here.

49
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,600
Generally, the weather is warm. So t-shirts, shorts for guys, light dresses for girls.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,089
Do like the locals and wear sandals.

51
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,560
They're perfect for the beach, temples, and even the rainstorm,

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,890
but if you're planning on doing some hiking remember bring some sturdy shoes.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,880
I have a leech on my leg.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,280
Treatment?  Salt water.

55
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,709
There we go.

56
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,989
Yeah, bro, that's my blood.

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,810
Remember Sri Lanka is tropical

58
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,149
So it's a good idea to bring a rain check any time of year.

59
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,989
If you're coming to the mountainous areas like Nuwara Eliya,

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,620
also bring an extra layer, like a jacket

61
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,872
because it does get cold at night,

62
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,160
and an umbrella is always a good idea.

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,300
Don't forget your hat for the sun and the rain.

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,899
The best way to avoid offending locals is to be respectful when you visit a temple.

65
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,779
If you are a lady,

66
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:22,999
you want to cover up as much as possible.

67
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,870
Definitely cover your shoulders.

68
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,323
Wear pants down past your knees or an easy dress to throw on.

69
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:30,530
You want to cover your midriff as well.

70
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,280
And everyone has to take their shoes off when in a temple.

71
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,440
As a man, definitely want to try to wear pants.

72
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,979
Also wearing white is a good call, but the biggest,

73
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,440
biggest thing that you could do to offend the local is to take a selfie with the Buddha.

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,223
Putting your back towards the Buddha is a big sign of disrespect.

75
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:54,520
Also any imagery of the Buddha,  t-shirts, don't wear those.

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,180
But even if you have a tattoo of the Buddha,

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,700
unfortunately, that's a strike three and you're out.

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,520
That's what you need to know before you go.

79
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,969
Let's get back to day one of the trip.

80
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,060
Welcome to downtown Colombo.

81
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,540
The first stop on our adventure is here at the old Dutch hospital.

82
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,324
It's actually the oldest building in all of Colombo,

83
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:29,249
and it was originally a hospital for soldiers and officers from the Dutch East India Company.

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,380
This entire area is known as Fort,

85
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,880
and that's because since the time of the Arabs in the 7th century the Portuguese, the British, and the Dutch

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,159
have all used this place as a fort and a trading port.

87
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,260
And one of the questions I have on this whole trip is:

88
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,209
Why would foreigners come so far to establish a presence on this island?

89
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,560
And what legacy has been left behind of all this blending of culture?

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,950
The first place that we're stopping on this adventure is the Ministry of Crab.

91
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,980
It's a restaurant in this complex because recently this entire hospital was converted

92
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,020
into a shopping and dining complex with tons of great boutiques and restaurants,

93
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,240
including the Ministry of Crab, which has been ranked as one the top 25 restaurants in all of Asia.

94
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Let's go get some lunch.

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
Ministry of Crab is all about seafood.

96
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:30,009
It's about crabs, but we're starting things off with some

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,840
oysters done with their two special house sauces and served on a cricket bat.

98
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,940
I love oysters. I'm really excited about this one because

99
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,920
it's got a hot sauce and soy sauce, which are two things that I also love.

100
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,019
Keep calm and crab on.

101
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,309
First main stop is Gangaram  Temple,

102
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,019
which is a Buddhist temple here in Colombo.

103
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,920
It's pretty awesome because it mixes a lot of different Buddhist influences from around the Buddhist world.

104
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,911
I think some of my first impressions here ...can't help but notice the similarity with India.

105
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,199
One of the biggest differences

106
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,140
Is that Sri Lanka is a majority Buddhist country

107
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,640
whereas India's a majority Hindu country. 
 Buddhism did come from India,

108
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,830
but it really took root here in Sri Lanka and the country has been a center of Buddhist learning for

109
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,719
thousands of years, helping spread the religion from its earliest days around the world.

110
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,730
I really love the first day of being in a country because it's a combination of

111
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,200
the small knowledge that you have that kind of attracted you to come here;

112
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
the curiosity that drove you to travel in the first place,

113
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,920
as well as all the new sensations and bits of information you're getting as you go.

114
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,820
It's kind of like getting a bunch of different puzzle pieces and trying to put them all together.

115
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,089
Pretty awesome way to start off our trip in Sri Lanka....

116
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,419
coming to a beautiful Buddhist temple like this, but this one's a little quirky.

117
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,182
It's a little different,  and it has all these different Buddhist artifacts

118
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,690
from all over the Buddhist world,

119
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,020
not to mention lots of donated items

120
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,918
like vintage cameras and old automobiles.

121
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,840
So it's kind of like part museum, part school, part temple, and very unique.

122
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,280
Buddhist bric-a-brac, but all donated.

123
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,600
It's really cool because Buddhism is expressed differently in the different countries.

124
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
The type of Buddhism practice here is the same as in Thailand,

125
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
as in Cambodia as in Tibet..

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,820
different than China, Japan, Korea.

127
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,450
You can see a lot of examples of these different types of Buddhas.

128
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,189
It's really cool to see how the same religions expressed slightly differently, artistically,

129
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,480
and spiritually in this part of Asia.

130
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Also, what I find fascinating about Buddhism is that it is a spiritual outlook.

131
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,520
It's a belief in the accomplishments of the

132
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,280
Buddha in attaining enlightenment and as an example for the average person to try to strive towards.

133
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,419
But what's cool about that is that  before the Buddha became the Buddha,

134
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,719
he was a Hindu, and there're Hindu gods all over temples, all over all Buddhist temples

135
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,420
So it's kind of interesting to walk in and you see the Buddha,

136
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,278
but you also see Ganesh and you see some of these other Hindu deities.

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,500
Just keeps things very colorful, and the art here is incredible.

138
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,660
This all just makes me excited for what's to come in two days.

139
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,700
We're hitting one of the birthplace of Buddhism in this country, an ancient city with amazing temples.

140
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,555
We're going to be learning a lot more,

141
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,689
and this is really just the tip of the iceberg.

142
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,680
On that note, I think it's time for us to go on..

143
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,100
head on out and keep exploring Colombo.

144
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Let's go.

145
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:55,440
Just walking through the Pettah Market district, really cool.

146
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,660
There's a lot going on and it'll be kind of a sensory overload at times.

147
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,320
But this is the main market center in Colombo.

148
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,680
It's right next to the port.  You have mosques.

149
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,280
You have temples,  both Hindu and Buddhist.

150
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,720
We're actually passing a Hindu temple right now.

151
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,760
This is super lucky.   We are at the top of the Red Mosque.

152
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,100
It's the largest mosque in Sri Lanka.

153
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,060
It's actually... the minarets.. the top of the minarets are based off of a pomegranate.

154
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,980
Even though the building was built in 1908,

155
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,720
it's been built up and is now the largest mosque in Sri Lanka,

156
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,318
not to mention incredibly beautiful.

157
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:04,279
We're super lucky to be up here.

158
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,379
The people at the mosque are super friendly, but this is cool. This is a different experience

159
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,200
There's about 8% of the population here in Sri Lanka that are Islamic

160
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,990
That influence, Islam,  has been here for a very long time.

161
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,629
We are overlooking the port right here,

162
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,800
and the port is what brought all the foreigners to Sri Lanka from ancient times.

163
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,758
The Arabs came here in the seventh century,

164
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:30,259
and then they were later followed by the Portuguese, the Dutch,  and the British.

165
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,639
But it's really cool to see how this culture has survived.

166
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,780
It's just really one part of all the diversity that makes Sri Lanka such an interesting destination

167
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,049
and this is an architecturally  beautiful place and

168
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,210
also a great spot to see where this city began, right here on the port.

169
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,560
How's day one so far, Carlos?

170
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,472
Day one's awesome.

171
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:50,700
It's very similar to India in a lot of ways,

172
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,399
but it's a lot more relaxing,

173
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,660
fewer people,  a lot more humid than Rajasthan,

174
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,739
but it's a beautiful city.

175
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:03,660
Looking forward to adventuring out into the wilderness and getting out of town.

176
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,619
That'll be nice.

177
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,120
First impressions:

178
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,800
Weather reminds me of southern Thailand.

179
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,620
I love it. Love me some humidity.

180
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,900
Food...excellent.

181
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,260
My goal for the rest of the trip?

182
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,790
I need to see an elephant.  That hasn't happened yet.

183
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,910
From what I hear that's going to happen tomorrow,

184
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,910
which I'm very excited about.

185
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,200
I am very pleasantly surprised by Colombo.

186
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,820
For being the capital city of Sri Lanka,

187
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,920
I expected it to be a bit more hectic. It's not.

188
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,940
I expected it to be hotter.  It isn't.

189
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,360
I love the fact that we're ending it right next to the beach.

190
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,750
There's only 22 million people in this country, and it's compared to India with over a billion.

191
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,989
It's got a lot of same feel, but way less people, less heat, and it's a bit humid, but it's not too hot.

192
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,310
Personally, I think this is a really cool place to end it.

193
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,380
We're looking over the port right here.

194
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,460
This whole field was created by the Dutch to put cannons in,

195
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,509
and now they're reclaiming land over here

196
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,480
with Chinese investment to build a whole new super city.

197
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,500
And it might look totally different than it does now in five or ten years.

198
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,689
Yeah, totally.. Sri Lanka is changing.

199
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,060
Colombo is changing.

200
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,379
They've had peace here now for nearly a decade, and I think that

201
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,140
judging from the people we've spoken to today,

202
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,970
things are really on the up-and-up.

203
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,340
Sri Lanka is the destination to come visit.

204
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm super stoked. I can't wait for tomorrow

205
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,080
We have so much more to explore, so much more to see,

206
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,520
and we're taking you all with us.

207
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,960
This is the coast. But from here, we're going inland.

208
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,339
We're going to a lot of cool places.

209
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,090
