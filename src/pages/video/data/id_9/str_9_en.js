00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,150
- Hey, usually I share
with you my opinion,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,380
but this time I would like to

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,360
ask you for your opinion.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,420
What would you do in, in this situation

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,253
I will describe you

6
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:11,490
Or how would you configure the situation?

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,350
Imagine there is a research team,

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,160
a group of programmers/researchers

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,470
who are doing some experiments.

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,520
They're trying to solve some problems,

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,000
not problem, problems usually.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,770
They're all looking at these problems

13
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,730
from different perspectives,
from different angles.

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,410
They're, and they are working on papers.

15
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,530
They're not only writing code

16
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,470
but they're also writing
scientific papers, academic papers

17
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,260
which are supposed to be published

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,370
in the end of the research
or during the research.

19
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,030
The papers are usually written

20
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,160
by not a single person,

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,510
but a few people.

22
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,840
So one person is writing.

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,067
And another person is
helping to edit the paper.

24
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:51,900
Another one is participating
in the discussions.

25
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,960
So maybe not even, you
know, typing the text there

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,460
but discussing the problems
and and suggesting.

27
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,880
Suggesting

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,730
solutions

29
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,730
and how to move the research
into a better direction.

30
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,150
So it's a group work, it's a teamwork.

31
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,110
But then the result of this teamwork

32
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,090
there is a paper which has an author,

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,520
an author or a number of authors

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,960
or an author and coauthors.

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,250
But usually now in academic world,

36
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,250
they just have a list of authors.

37
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,240
John,

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,274
Sarah,

39
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:24,530
Peter.

40
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,430
Three authors.

41
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,920
So the question is, how do we decide

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,820
in a group

43
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,950
who will be the author?

44
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,800
Let's say we have 10 people in the team.

45
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,435
10 people working

46
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,230
on the problem.

47
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,756
They working on the software solution and

48
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:43,913
they will generate five different papers.

49
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,710
So there are

50
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,530
basically three approaches.

51
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,229
Approach number one is we all

52
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,490
become coauthors.

53
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,026
10 people, 10 author, no
matter who is publishing,

54
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,730
no matter who is writing,

55
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,330
no matter what kind of paper it is,

56
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,080
no matter what the paper is about.

57
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,340
10 people, they just go in there.

58
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,280
They become all authors, no
exceptions, no exclusions.

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,330
That's a scenario number one.

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,540
And remember, we are
trying to make a rule.

61
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,550
So we are trying to decide

62
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,340
that it's gonna be happen from now

63
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,390
till the very end of our

64
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,960
the end of a lifetime
of this, of this group.

65
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,200
Not even the project, but the group.

66
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,790
So it's, it's a rule it has to be set.

67
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,480
So everybody knows what is
the rule, what to expect.

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,420
Approach number two, the
person who is responsible,

69
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,960
the main author, the main person

70
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,799
who is actually typing most of the text,

71
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,420
who is driving the paper
forward, becomes the author.

72
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,230
And we always assign that person.

73
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,010
So when we start writing a new paper,

74
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,030
we say, okay now it's your paper.

75
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,280
So this is, this is Sarah.

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,490
So Sarah, okay, write a
paper, make it your paper.

77
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,330
You will publish.

78
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,600
And Sarah

79
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,523
becomes

80
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:55,680
the author number one.

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,510
And then Sarah invites
other people as she wishes.

82
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,520
She says Peter was helping
me, so I invite Peter.

83
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,210
Maybe she doesn't even explain why.

84
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,120
It's just her personal decision.

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,030
She makes the decision
Peter is the coauthor.

86
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,860
So I invite Peter and we
don't debate this decision.

87
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,693
That's the rule.

88
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,020
So the author, the primary
author of the paper.

89
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,640
Even if this decision is not fair.

90
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,070
Maybe the author will just say

91
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,810
I don't want anybody to be coauthors.

92
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,010
So I just be myself.

93
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,460
It's just gonna be my paper.

94
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,860
And we all just eat it,

95
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,910
just swallow it,

96
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,940
and say, okay, that's the way it is.

97
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,220
That's the second approach.

98
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,028
And the approach number
three, which I use,

99
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:37,770
which I see more and more
often is the approach

100
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,610
where the decision is made ad hoc.

101
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,960
So we just, we just make a decision

102
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,310
with no particular rule behind it.

103
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,620
It's just, yeah, these three people,

104
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,170
because they were working
more on this paper,

105
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,980
just because, so decisions
is made by somehow.

106
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,600
There's no clear explanation.

107
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,670
There's no real set of
rules written on the wall,

108
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,570
and anybody can just
look at it and understand

109
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,950
okay that's the rule we use in our team.

110
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,860
So I'm asking you, what
do you think is better?

111
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,060
The first approach, the
second one or the third one?

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,020
So probably if you are
subscribed to my channel

113
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,220
then you will probably cross
out the option number three

114
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,910
because we are all, you
know, we all like rules.

115
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,709
I mean, I am trying to tell you this

116
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,129
for many many years on
my blog and my videos.

117
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,350
The rules are better than
the absence of rules.

118
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,750
But let's consider two first options.

119
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,250
The rule number one, everybody.

120
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,980
The rule number two, one
person and coauthors.

121
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,410
So what's good in the first approach?

122
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,630
It will not offend.

123
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,470
It is supposed to not offend anybody.

124
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,560
Of course, it may offend.

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,550
For example, the person
just quits the group,

126
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,960
and we still publish the paper.

127
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
So shall we include the person

128
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,397
who was working with us two
years ago on this project.

129
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:53,180
And she quit two years ago
and went to work for Google.

130
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,640
Now she's in Google,
but we continue writing,

131
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,560
continue working on that, continue writing

132
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,030
those papers we started two years ago.

133
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,120
Shall we include that
person as a coauthor?

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,200
That's a tricky question, hard to answer.

135
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,950
But if the answer will be, of course not,

136
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,340
then it will demotivate
people who stay with us.

137
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,040
Now they will understand that

138
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,680
no matter how much they invest right now,

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,810
the time and efforts,

140
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,460
they will be most probably excluded

141
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,840
if they decide to quit in sometime.

142
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,000
So that's the trickiest scenario.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,720
But still everybody means everybody.

144
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
10 people means 10 people.

145
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,150
Just everybody, to not offend anybody.

146
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,600
That's the principle.

147
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,130
And the second option,
there are also benefits.

148
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,350
So if you,

149
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,474
if you let the primary author

150
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:36,710
be the decision maker,

151
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,895
then it gives extra motivation,
additional motivation

152
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:41,490
for that person

153
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,260
to stand out

154
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,270
and to demonstrate their
achievements much better

155
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,390
than being just

156
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,320
inside a list of coauthors
among everybody else

157
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,260
who maybe not work as good as that person.

158
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,600
Because you know, in a team of 10 people

159
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840
it's impossible to imagine

160
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,370
that all 10 people they
contribute equally.

161
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,090
Sometimes there will be lazy people.

162
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,380
Sometimes there will be
people who don't work

163
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,740
because they don't like to work. Whatever.

164
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,030
There could be many
reasons for having people

165
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,810
who contribute much
less than somebody else.

166
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,160
So that's somebody else
who's a top contributor,

167
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,440
who works day and night on this paper,

168
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,570
who puts a lot of effort into it.

169
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,195
He or she will not be happy to see

170
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:25,110
that after the paper is published

171
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,400
his name or her name stays
on the position number five

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,690
among other 10 guys who,
most of who, or some of who,

173
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,470
barely touched the keyboard

174
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,420
during the lifetime of the project.

175
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,480
So that's a negative side.

176
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,740
It may demotivate that key performers,

177
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,040
if we apply the the principle

178
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,600
from the first scenario.

179
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,430
So in this case, the second scenario

180
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,330
is kind of gives advantages
to top performers.

181
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,210
It just says, you'll be the author.

182
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,620
You'll be the paper publisher.

183
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,900
So everybody else, they
will try to help you

184
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,067
in order to motivate you to involve,

185
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,700
to include me,

186
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,570
include them into the list of co-authors.

187
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,120
For example, I'm in the team.

188
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,040
I see this guy he's working
hard to publish a paper

189
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,165
and I see that the paper
potentially could be,

190
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:18,780
could be publishable and
could be really good paper.

191
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,210
I will try to help that person.

192
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,800
I will try to work with them.

193
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,630
I will try to say, how can I help you,

194
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,890
maybe invite me for the meeting,

195
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,680
invite me for the discussion.

196
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,930
Let me write something for you.

197
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,980
Maybe write you some software,

198
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,990
so I will try to help.

199
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,470
But

200
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,680
there are negative sides

201
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,080
and positive sides in both options.

202
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,390
So I'm asking you, what do you think?

203
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,950
Maybe you can share your experience

204
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,110
how it works in your team,

205
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,640
how it works in your group.

206
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,500
So how it happens.

207
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,333
What's the rule?

208
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,710
What's the principle of the authorship?

209
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,790
So who gets the privilege of

210
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,980
being authors of the papers
your group is publishing?

211
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,830
Thanks for listening.

212
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,010
I'm waiting for answers.

213
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,843
Stay tuned.

214
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,676
Bye-bye.
