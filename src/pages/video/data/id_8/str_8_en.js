00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:02,590
- Hey! I got a question from one

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,740
of my subscribers who found a
contradiction in two thoughts

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,660
which I deliver in my presentations.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,599
On one side, I'm saying that a programmer

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,810
has to work just a few hours a day.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,890
And I did say that.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,730
On another hand, on another side,

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,960
I'm saying that a good
programmer is the one

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,730
who is passionate about the
profession, who works a lot,

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,660
who basically doesn't
close the laptop ever.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,410
So where do I stand?

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,243
So what's right?

13
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:31,076
What's wrong?

14
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:32,770
Do programmers have to work a lot?

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,090
Or they have to just
spend a few hours a day?

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,923
And then the question

17
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:37,347
from this subscriber was,

18
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:38,510
"What else to do?"

19
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,420
If you just work for
two, three hours a day

20
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,570
then what do you do in
the rest of the time?

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,250
What the programmer, a good programmer,

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,100
who I believe is a good
programmer has to spend time for.

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,220
There is no contradiction

24
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,280
because I believe that

25
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,010
work

26
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,640
is one thing

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,300
and having fun doing programming

28
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,700
and working with the code,

29
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,150
working with technical
problems is another thing.

30
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,040
That's what I do.

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,040
That's what I think is makes sense to me.

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,410
When you do something
which gives fun to you,

33
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,310
when you learn something,

34
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,340
when you practice some new languages,

35
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,820
when you try some new frameworks,

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,260
when you create new frameworks,

37
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,540
when you read interesting books,

38
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,878
when you write interesting books,

39
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:22,700
when you write your blog posts,

40
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,280
when you answer questions
on stack overflow,

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,707
when you create some open
source path projects,

42
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:29,930
this is how you have fun.

43
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,330
This is your life.

44
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,740
So this is what you do
ideally, 24 hours a day.

45
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,960
Of course, you need time to sleep.

46
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,820
You need time to eat.

47
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,790
You need time to spend
time with your family.

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,409
But ideally in the perfect world,

49
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,739
24 hours a day, I would do that.

50
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,706
I would just spend time
to get fun from life

51
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,680
by working with computers.

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,026
This is not what I call work.

53
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,680
This is what I call
investment into the future.

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,497
This is how I invest
to make myself better,

55
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:57,620
to make myself as a professional, better.

56
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,910
That's my investment.

57
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,490
And then I have to live somehow,

58
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,320
'cause nobody's gonna pay me for that,

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,890
'cause this is how I make fun.

60
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,480
Some people play games on the computer,

61
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,340
they play Tanks,

62
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,169
they play World of Warcraft
and I don't do that.

63
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,078
I play with the code.

64
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:13,660
But nobody's gonna pay for that.

65
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,493
It's just fun.

66
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:15,740
On the other hand, I have to make money.

67
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,630
So I have to go somewhere and
do some projects for somebody.

68
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,230
So I have to write code for
somebody, for some company

69
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,283
for some employer or maybe some kind,

70
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,758
the customer or somebody who will pay.

71
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,660
And there will be no fun, less fun.

72
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,360
Of course, ideally in an ideal world,

73
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,410
I will also have fun there, but much less

74
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,970
In real world, it's much less fun.

75
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,880
And for most of you,
there'll be no fun at all

76
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,340
or really small amount of fun

77
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,437
because they will tell
you to do what they need.

78
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:45,760
And in most cases, you're not
gonna like that business wise.

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,790
You're not gonna like the
concept of what they do.

80
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,350
They're not gonna like,
you're not gonna like

81
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,880
the business cases and all that.

82
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,713
But you have to do that

83
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,980
in order to get the money, in
order to continue having fun,

84
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,600
in order to continue doing
something interesting,

85
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,480
in order to continue
investing into yourself.

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,880
So the more you can invest into yourself

87
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,099
the better professional you will become.

88
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,890
And the less amount of time

89
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,407
you will have to spend on making money.

90
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,860
So if you're very good professional,

91
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,849
a really top one, top world class guy,

92
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,591
who knows something very special

93
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,790
and who can solve really complex problems

94
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,408
can get, I don't know, $300 an hour.

95
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,850
Then you just can work
for one, two hours a day

96
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,420
and that will be enough for you.

97
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,540
To have enough money, to
have an ability to have fun.

98
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,370
So the more expensive
you are on the market,

99
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,540
the more professional you are,

100
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,187
the more these people will pay
for your 2, 3, 4 hours a day.

101
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:39,730
And then you can go back to fun.

102
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,900
And instead of playing Tanks
and playing World of Warcraft

103
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,270
but you will invest time into
yourself becoming better.

104
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,040
Because every time you have fun,

105
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,287
every time you do something interesting,

106
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,020
that's how you become better.

107
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,100
You cannot become better

108
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,550
by just doing routine work
where people pay for you.

109
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,370
No matter what you think about,

110
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,223
No matter what people who
hire you think about this.

111
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,930
You become better by doing things for fun.

112
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,747
I believe in that.

113
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,170
Because that's how you learn,

114
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,870
because that's how you practice new stuff.

115
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,660
That's how you face the
challenges much more actively

116
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,377
than when you work with stuff for money.

117
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:21,216
So there has to be the balance

118
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:23,414
between the time you spend

119
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:25,930
on the projects where
you collect the money

120
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,310
and the time you spend on projects

121
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,990
where you invest the money or your time.

122
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,963
And in an ideal world, like
two, three hours a day here

123
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:35,580
and all of your time here.

124
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,410
And if you do a lot of work
here, if you work eight hours

125
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,980
for your boss, eight
hours for your customer,

126
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,650
then you have almost zero time because you

127
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,080
you need to spend time with your family.

128
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,999
You need to sleep, you need to eat.

129
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,770
So there will be not enough time

130
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,180
to really invest into yourself.

131
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,460
And you will degrade quickly.

132
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,752
You will become just a
routine programmer who,

133
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,820
at best, can make an
average amount of money,

134
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,020
an average amount on the market.

135
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,950
So try to minimize the amount

136
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,410
of time you spend for your boss,

137
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,660
you spend for for the projects where

138
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,860
you collect the money

139
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,313
and spend more time on the projects

140
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:12,093
where you invest time
and money into yourself.

141
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:13,580
But on the other hand,

142
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,410
you cannot make this time
taking all of your time.

143
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,952
Because in this case

144
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,210
you stop making money and eventually

145
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,620
you will again get out of the market.

146
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,453
So you will,

147
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,720
you may go out of the
market because you will

148
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,330
stop understanding what the
customers may need from you.

149
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,580
So you may stop inventing.

150
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,860
You may start inventing
things which nobody needs.

151
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,850
You may go into learning something

152
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,250
which is completely
detached on the reality.

153
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,770
So there has to be the
balance between investing

154
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,160
into yourself and collecting the paychecks

155
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,740
50-50, I don't know - maybe this balance.

156
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,513
But I am always into trying
to make this part larger,

157
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,770
trying to make investing part,

158
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,880
'cause it's more fun,

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,011
larger than collecting the money.

160
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:56,460
So think about this,

161
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,800
this is the balance - a few
hours here, more hours there.

162
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,940
And that's how you grow,

163
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,040
that's how you become better,

164
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,550
that's how your profile grows,

165
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,930
that's how you eventually get yourself

166
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,510
into the situation where one
hour of your time costs $300.

167
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,580
In this case, you can work

168
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,680
for a few hours or maybe
a few days and then

169
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,530
and then take a rest for a few weeks.

170
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,610
Or maybe you can work for for
a month and then take a rest,

171
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,110
a long vacation, not a
vacation, but a long time

172
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,220
to have fun with computers
for maybe a year or so.

173
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,620
That would be the ideal position.

174
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,480
Not eight hours every day in the office.

175
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,130
That's completely lousy position

176
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,496
which totally degrades
you and leads you nowhere.

177
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:37,710
I hope I told you something interesting.

178
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,010
Thanks for listening.

179
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,843
