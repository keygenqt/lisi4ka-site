00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,470
- Hey, if you work in a
company, in a team in a company

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,820
and you are at least
a mid-level developer,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,350
then once in a while,
your team will ask you

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,510
to interview new people who
would like to join the team.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,130
So you will be the interviewer.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,583
I play this role a few times
a week that's for sure,

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,100
and there is a problem with the interviews

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,940
when you are an active interviewer.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,560
Actually, the problem is even bigger

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,963
when you are not a very
active interviewer.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,110
The problem is how do
you explain your opinion

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,240
about the person you interview
to the rest of the team?

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,500
They will give you the programmer,

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
they will ask you to interview that guy

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,950
and then after the interview,

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,300
they will ask you what do you think?

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,860
And you have to explain your conclusions.

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,800
You have to summarize your
experience after the interview.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,050
And what's more interesting is that

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,920
they will sometimes ask you

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,780
to give that summary after a while.

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,470
They will ask you right
after the interview,

23
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,480
but maybe after a while as
well, maybe in a few weeks even.

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,210
And it's hard, it's hard to remember

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,129
the people you interview.

26
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,840
It's hard to remember
why you give the opinion.

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,053
So I share my recipe how I do it.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,750
I design a very small file for myself,

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,520
a very small template of
the most important questions

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,420
I ask people who I interview,

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,960
and they're not technical questions.

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,820
I don't really specify the
exact Java questions I may ask,

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,620
but I broke down all the aspects

34
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,760
of questions I ask that guy.

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,347
And then I approximately
defined the ranges

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,670
in which I measure the answers I hear.

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,470
For example, I pay attention
to the open source history

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,670
of the people who I interview.

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,200
So it does matter for me.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,880
When you come to me for the interview,

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,700
I will ask you what's your
experience in open source?

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,300
Did you try to commit to
some open source projects,

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,480
or maybe you have your
own open source projects?

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,570
That kind of questions.

45
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,100
If your answer is zero, I have nothing.

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,330
Then I give you zero in
this particular line.

47
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,039
If you tell me that you
are an active contributor

48
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,520
to a few large open source products

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,620
and you have your own stuff,
then I will give you seven, 10.

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,780
My range is from zero to 10.

51
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,920
And then I quickly in just one sentence,

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,800
explain to myself why
I gave you that remark,

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
why I gave you five.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
I just put a few words there to remember.

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,130
And I have other things like education.

56
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,250
I pay attention to where you graduated.

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,440
One thing is your bachelor,
or maybe no education

58
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,720
in no university, or maybe
you get a PhD in Stanford.

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,070
So on the range from zero to
10, I will give you the mark

60
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,123
and I'll put some words there.

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,420
Another thing I pay attention to

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,152
is I usually give to Java
programmers or Ruby programmers

63
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:56,090
and to C++ programmers, I give
a very small piece of code

64
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,990
and I ask the people I
interview to find bugs,

65
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,040
to find problems in this piece of code.

66
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,370
And according to their answers,

67
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,030
I make my judgment during the interview

68
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,730
how good or bad they are,

69
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,890
and sometimes it's not about good or bad.

70
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,130
Actually, often it's
not about good or bad,

71
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,460
it's about what kind of bugs they find.

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,240
Some people see low level problems there.

73
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,210
Some people see high level
bugs, design problems there.

74
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,910
So it's not about actually
judging on your level,

75
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,380
but about judging what
you pay attention to.

76
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,300
Like, what are you a designer,
or you're the programmer,

77
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,400
or maybe the architect?

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,720
So I write down my judgment,
I write down my conclusions,

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
and I give you the number from zero to 10.

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,620
Then I fill up this form.

81
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,620
It's a simple one page document.

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,100
I put some details there.

83
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,830
The date of the interview,

84
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,310
what kind of general
information I received from you.

85
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,610
Very short, very brief,

86
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,040
and I put this document to my computer,

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,240
and I have these documents
for the last years.

88
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,380
I can go back a few years
back and I can open.

89
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,260
For example, I interviewed
you a few years ago

90
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,900
you come back to me again,
then I open the file

91
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,310
and I know what kind of
questions I was asking you,

92
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,660
what kind of answers I got,

93
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,130
and why I decided that
your level is five here,

94
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,850
three here, seven here,
and so on and so forth.

95
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,380
I suggest you do the same.

96
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,320
Define for yourself the
things you pay attention to,

97
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,320
define the ranges, define the
way you measure the answers,

98
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,310
and make this template the same
for everybody you interview.

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,440
And don't expect your company or your team

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,320
to provide this template to you.

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,810
Sometimes they would.

102
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,970
The large companies
they usually expect you

103
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,350
to somehow structure the
result of the interview,

104
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,000
somehow structure your conclusion.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,160
But I would suggest to
still do your own work

106
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,780
and define your own template,

107
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,610
your own way of how you interview people,

108
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,000
what you pay attention to.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,410
And stick to this template

110
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,140
through the years of interviews you do.

111
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,520
In this case, it'll be
easier for you to compare

112
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,870
a candidate to candidate
because you can see the numbers.

113
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,180
Even though people are different,

114
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,060
of course it's hard to
compare them by the numbers,

115
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,440
but still you will be able
to explain to your team

116
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,280
why this candidate is a go for
you, and this one is no go.

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,300
So this explanation will be based

118
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,300
on some objective information,
objective measurements.

119
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,810
Of course, they're not really objective,

120
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,910
but still it's better than
two subjective opinions.

121
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,790
I like this guy, I don't like this guy.

122
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,490
It's hard to explain to the management.

123
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,040
It kinda feels like you're
not really professional.

124
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,160
But if you have a document for this one

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,310
and a document for that one, very short,

126
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,360
still it's better to
explain your decision.

127
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,620
That's my recipe.

128
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,453
Thanks for listening.

129
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,733
Stay tuned. Bye bye.
