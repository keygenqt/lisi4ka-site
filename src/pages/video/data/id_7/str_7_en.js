00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:13,510
- Hey, if you work in a
company, in a team in a company
and you are at least
a mid-level developer,
then once in a while,
your team will ask you
to interview new people who
would like to join the team.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,130
So you will be the interviewer.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:23,940
I play this role a few times
a week that's for sure,
and there is a problem with the interviews
when you are an active interviewer.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,963
Actually, the problem is even bigger
when you are not a very
active interviewer.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,240
The problem is how do
you explain your opinion
about the person you interview
to the rest of the team?

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,300
They will give you the programmer,
they will ask you to interview that guy
and then after the interview,
they will ask you what do you think?

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,860
And you have to explain your conclusions.

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,800
You have to summarize your
experience after the interview.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,780
And what's more interesting is that
they will sometimes ask you
to give that summary after a while.

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,480
They will ask you right
after the interview,
but maybe after a while as
well, maybe in a few weeks even.

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,129
And it's hard, it's hard to remember
the people you interview.

26
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,840
It's hard to remember
why you give the opinion.

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,053
So I share my recipe how I do it.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,520
I design a very small file for myself,
a very small template of
the most important questions

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,960
I ask people who I interview,
and they're not technical questions.

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:34,760
I don't really specify the
exact Java questions I may ask,
but I broke down all the aspects
of questions I ask that guy.

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:45,670
And then I approximately
defined the ranges
in which I measure the answers I hear.

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,670
For example, I pay attention
to the open source history
of the people who I interview.

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,200
So it does matter for me.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,700
When you come to me for the interview,
I will ask you what's your
experience in open source?

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,480
Did you try to commit to
some open source projects,
or maybe you have your
own open source projects?

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,570
That kind of questions.

45
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,100
If your answer is zero, I have nothing.

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,330
Then I give you zero in
this particular line.

47
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:16,620
If you tell me that you
are an active contributor
to a few large open source products
and you have your own stuff,
then I will give you seven, 10.

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,780
My range is from zero to 10.

51
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,080
And then I quickly in just one sentence,
explain to myself why
I gave you that remark,
why I gave you five.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
I just put a few words there to remember.

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,130
And I have other things like education.

56
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,250
I pay attention to where you graduated.

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,720
One thing is your bachelor,
or maybe no education
in no university, or maybe
you get a PhD in Stanford.

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,123
So on the range from zero to
10, I will give you the mark
and I'll put some words there.

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:03:02,040
Another thing I pay attention to
is I usually give to Java
programmers or Ruby programmers
and to C++ programmers, I give
a very small piece of code
and I ask the people I
interview to find bugs,
to find problems in this piece of code.

66
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,890
And according to their answers,
I make my judgment during the interview
how good or bad they are,
and sometimes it's not about good or bad.

70
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,460
Actually, often it's
not about good or bad,
it's about what kind of bugs they find.

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,240
Some people see low level problems there.

73
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,210
Some people see high level
bugs, design problems there.

74
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,380
So it's not about actually
judging on your level,
but about judging what
you pay attention to.

76
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,400
Like, what are you a designer,
or you're the programmer,
or maybe the architect?

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,360
So I write down my judgment,
I write down my conclusions,
and I give you the number from zero to 10.

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,620
Then I fill up this form.

81
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,620
It's a simple one page document.

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,100
I put some details there.

83
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,310
The date of the interview,
what kind of general
information I received from you.

85
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:55,240
Very short, very brief,
and I put this document to my computer,
and I have these documents
for the last years.

88
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,380
I can go back a few years
back and I can open.

89
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:13,850
For example, I interviewed
you a few years ago
you come back to me again,
then I open the file
and I know what kind of
questions I was asking you,
what kind of answers I got,
and why I decided that
your level is five here,
three here, seven here,
and so on and so forth.

95
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,380
I suggest you do the same.

96
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:28,310
Define for yourself the
things you pay attention to,
define the ranges, define the
way you measure the answers,
and make this template the same
for everybody you interview.

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,320
And don't expect your company or your team
to provide this template to you.

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,810
Sometimes they would.

102
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:42,000
The large companies
they usually expect you
to somehow structure the
result of the interview,
somehow structure your conclusion.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But I would suggest to
still do your own work
and define your own template,
your own way of how you interview people,
what you pay attention to.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,140
And stick to this template
through the years of interviews you do.

111
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,870
In this case, it'll be
easier for you to compare
a candidate to candidate
because you can see the numbers.

113
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:11,280
Even though people are different,
of course it's hard to
compare them by the numbers,
but still you will be able
to explain to your team
why this candidate is a go for
you, and this one is no go.

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,300
So this explanation will be based
on some objective information,
objective measurements.

119
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,910
Of course, they're not really objective,
but still it's better than
two subjective opinions.

121
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,790
I like this guy, I don't like this guy.

122
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,490
It's hard to explain to the management.

123
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,040
It kinda feels like you're
not really professional.

124
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:37,360
But if you have a document for this one
and a document for that one, very short,
still it's better to
explain your decision.

127
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,620
That's my recipe.

128
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,453
Thanks for listening.

129
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,733
Stay tuned. Bye bye.
